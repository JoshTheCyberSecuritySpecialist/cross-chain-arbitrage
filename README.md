Setup


Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/JoshTheCyberSecuritySpecialist/cross-chain-arbitrage.git
cd cross-chain-arbitrage

Configure the Bot
Open arbitrage.py in your favorite code editor.
Replace the following placeholders with your credentials and keys:
YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID â†’ Infura project ID.

How It Works

Retrieve Token Prices:
Uses the Dexscreener API to get the latest prices for tokens on different chains.

Detect Arbitrage Opportunities:
Compares prices across Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain with a configurable threshold.

Execute Trades:
Executes trades on Uniswap when a profitable opportunity is detected.

Cross-Chain Transfers:
(Optional) Uses bridges like Multichain or Synapse to transfer tokens across blockchains.

Improvements to Consider

Gas Optimization: Monitor gas fees and execute trades only when profitable.
Multi-Chain Support: Extend to other blockchains like Polygon or Avalanche.
Bridge Integration: Add automated cross-chain transfers.
